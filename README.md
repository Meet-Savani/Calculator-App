## Customization

You can easily customize the appearance of the calculator by editing the CSS in `style.css`. Here are some ways you can personalize it:

- **Colors:**  
  - Change background gradients in the `body` selector.  
  - Modify button colors (`.circle`, `.operator`, `.sum`) for a different theme.  

- **Shadows and Effects:**  
  - Adjust or remove `box-shadow` properties to increase or soften depth.  
  - Tweak hover effects under `.circle:hover` and `.sum:hover` selectors.

- **Sizes and Spacing:**  
  - Modify button dimensions (`width`, `height` in `.circle`).  
  - Adjust margins and padding to change spacing between elements.

- **Fonts:**  
  - Change the Google Font import to try different typefaces.  
  - Adjust font sizes for better readability or style.

Feel free to experiment with these styles to match your personal or brand preferences!
